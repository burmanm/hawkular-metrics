= RHQ-Metrics Explorer (and UI Components)

== Quickstart
Show me what the RHQ-Metrics Explorer does: https://vimeo.com/101576357[RHQ Metrics Explorer Video]   _Length - 8:33_


== What does it do?
The explorer provides a simple UI for:
1. Inserting/creating  data in various ways

2. Viewing the data in the database both visually via a graph

3. An example of the capabilities of rhq-metrics and the Angular.js charting components.

== Purpose
This explorer showcases the capabilities of rhq-metrics and the complementary UI components used to visualize the metric data in meaningful ways.

The explorer is also very good at populating a datastore and viewing its results graphically as well as a learning tool for working with the *rhq-metrics* suite.

The visual UI https://angularjs.org/[Angular.js] components provided by the rhq-metrics project are the primary deliverable of the console/explorer module and are intended to be plug-n-play components for quickly creating dashboards for the rhq-metrics backend.

The Angular.js components will be published as http://bower.io[Bower] packaged components(think maven repo) and published to the bower repository to be easily installed and consumed in other javascript applications.


== Install
The standard **mvn install** will build the war artifact in 'console/target/metrics-console-*.war'. Place this along with the 'rest-servlet/target/rest-servlet-*.war' in your app server deployments directory to have a functioning frontend/backend.
Browse http://127.0.0.1:8080/[http://127.0.0.1:8080/] and explore...

== Dev Install (optional)
This is an optional development install for a standard http://gruntjs.com[Grunt] project.
Grunt is a build tool for javscript webapps just like maven is for java. The build capabilities of grunt are not used here as we are using maven for building/deploying. Grunt is used here for starting a development environment that automatically refreshes itself whenever html, css or javascript files change. Making a fast/agile environment for web development.

0. Go to proper directory **'cd console/src/main/webapp'**
1. Install http://nodejs.org[Node.js]  (and npm) if not already installed
2. Install the node packages: **'npm install -g grunt-cli bower karma'**
(if you get an EACESS permission errors you may need to use sudo to the do the install)
3. Install npm packages for tooling: **'npm install'**
4. Optional: Install http://bower.io[Bower] packages for UI: **'bower install'**
5. Start the http://gruntjs.com[Grunt] Server: **'grunt serve'**
6. Browse http://127.0.0.1:9000/[http://127.0.0.1:9000] and explore...

Grunt will automatically launch a url for you in your browser and will reload any changes in real time to the browser. Feel Free to play around.

Tip: Make sure that you have a rest backend running so that the UI console can connect to something.

1. **'cd rest-servlet'**
2. **'mvn wildfly:run'**
